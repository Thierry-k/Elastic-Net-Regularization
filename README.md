## Elastic Net Performance Analysis

This project explores the performance of the **Elastic Net regularization method** in high-dimensional linear regression models, particularly when features are correlated. It was developed as part of the coursework for **MAT4376 – High Dimensional Data Analysis** at the University of Ottawa.

## Objective

To assess how Elastic Net performs compared to its constituent methods (Lasso and Ridge) by:
- Simulating datasets with varying feature correlations.
- Tuning the Elastic Net mixing parameter (**α**) and penalty term (**λ**) using cross-validation.
- Evaluating predictive accuracy and model sparsity.
- Conducting a Monte Carlo simulation across multiple correlation scenarios.

## Features

- **Simulation of Multivariate Normal Data** using Cholesky decomposition
- **Elastic Net Regression** for multiple values of α (0.1, 0.5, 0.9)
- **Cross-validation** to optimize λ
- **MSE-based performance comparison** across α values
- **Monte Carlo simulation** to evaluate model stability across ρ ∈ [−0.9, 0.9]
- **Visualization** of MSE trends vs. correlation strength
